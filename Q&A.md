# Q&A (ChatGPT Assisted)

```python
grid = lambda args: (
    triton.cdiv(SEQ_LEN, args["BLOCK_SIZE_Q"]),
    BATCH_SIZE * NUM_HEADS,
    1,
)
```

**Q: Can we replace BLOCK_SIZE_Q with BLOCK_SIZE_K in the grid and still mean the same thing?**

A: Not quite. While both `BLOCK_SIZE_Q` and `BLOCK_SIZE_K` are used in the attention computation, only `BLOCK_SIZE_Q` is relevant for the grid shape. The grid's X-dimension controls how many queries each kernel processes. Even though the attention calculation involves `K^T`, we are still tiling over blocks of queries when defining the grid. The role of BLOCK_SIZE_K typically comes into play inside the kernel, where we loop over key blocks when calculating the dot product. But in terms of the grid — which defines how we divide the work across kernels — it’s `BLOCK_SIZE_Q` that matters, since each kernel is responsible for processing a chunk of the query sequence.


**Q: In the notes, each block had 2 queries — so does that mean `BLOCK_SIZE_Q` = 2 or `BLOCK_SIZE_Q` = 4?**

A: It depends on how many query rows each block contains. In the diagrams, Q had a total of 8 rows (query vectors), and each block was shown as containing 2 queries. That means `BLOCK_SIZE_Q` = 2 in that case. If each block had only 4 rows, then `BLOCK_SIZE_Q` = 4. So the value of BLOCK_SIZE_Q directly reflects how many queries are grouped into one block that is processed by a single kernel instance.

**Q: Since K is transposed, how can we define the grid over Q? Doesn't transposing affect the grid shape?**

A: Great intuition, but the grid is not tied to how the K matrix is laid out or transposed. Even though K is transposed when computing QK^T, what actually determines the grid is how we split the queries (Q). This is because the goal of the grid is to assign each kernel to compute the output for a subset of the query positions. The fact that K is transposed just affects how the matmul is performed inside each kernel — not how the kernels are launched. So, we can safely define the grid over Q without worrying about the transposition of K.

**Q: Why is the Y-axis of the grid equal to BATCH_SIZE * NUM_HEADS?**

A: Each attention head is an independent computation, and we typically apply multi-head attention across a batch of sequences. So if you have 4 sequences in a batch and 8 attention heads, you end up with 4 × 8 = 32 completely independent attention calculations. Each of these needs its own Q, K, and V matrices.

Therefore, we launch one kernel per **(head, batch)** pair. That’s why the grid’s Y-dimension is `BATCH_SIZE * NUM_HEADS`. This allows each kernel to process the attention for one head of one sequence in the batch, effectively covering the entire batch in one go.

```python
stride_Q_batch = Q.stride(0)
stride_Q_head = Q.stride(1)
stride_Q_seq = Q.stride(2)
stride_Q_dim = Q.stride(3)
```

(similar stride extraction is done for `K` and `V`)

**Q: What does `stride_Q_batch = Q.stride(0)` mean? How can it tell Triton how to move from one batch to another?**

A: Great question — this line can definitely seem confusing at first. It might look like stride(0) is telling Triton to jump "zero" indices to move to the next batch, but that's not how strides work. In PyTorch, calling `.stride(i)` gives you the number of elements to skip in memory to move by one step along dimension i. So if your tensor Q has shape `(BATCH_SIZE, NUM_HEADS, SEQ_LEN, HEAD_DIM)`, then `Q.stride(0)` returns how far you need to jump in memory to go from one batch to the next.

For example, suppose Q.shape = (2, 4, 8, 128). Then calling Q.stride() might return (4096, 1024, 128, 1). This means:

To move from one batch to the next, skip 4096 elements
To move between heads, skip 1024
To move along the sequence, skip 128
To move across dimensions within a token, skip 1
So in the line stride_Q_batch = Q.stride(0), we're extracting the stride needed to hop between batches in memory.

This is necessary because Triton operates on raw memory pointers and does not assume any tensor layout. The stride gives it the information it needs to navigate the tensor manually and correctly. So stride(0) is not saying "jump zero" — it's telling you the size of the batch chunk in memory.
