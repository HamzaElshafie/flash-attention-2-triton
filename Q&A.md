# Q&A (ChatGPT Assisted)

```python
grid = lambda args: (
    triton.cdiv(SEQ_LEN, args["BLOCK_SIZE_Q"]),
    BATCH_SIZE * NUM_HEADS,
    1,
)
```

**Q: Can we replace BLOCK_SIZE_Q with BLOCK_SIZE_K in the grid and still mean the same thing?**

A: Not quite. While both `BLOCK_SIZE_Q` and `BLOCK_SIZE_K` are used in the attention computation, only `BLOCK_SIZE_Q` is relevant for the grid shape. The grid's X-dimension controls how many queries each kernel processes. Even though the attention calculation involves `K^T`, we are still tiling over blocks of queries when defining the grid.

The role of BLOCK_SIZE_K typically comes into play inside the kernel, where we loop over key blocks when calculating the dot product. But in terms of the grid — which defines how we divide the work across kernels — it’s `BLOCK_SIZE_Q` that matters, since each kernel is responsible for processing a chunk of the query sequence.

--------

**Q: In the notes, each block had 2 queries — so does that mean `BLOCK_SIZE_Q` = 2 or `BLOCK_SIZE_Q` = 4?**

A: It depends on how many query rows each block contains. In the diagrams, Q had a total of 8 rows (query vectors), and each block was shown as containing 2 queries. That means `BLOCK_SIZE_Q` = 2 in that case. If each block had only 4 rows, then `BLOCK_SIZE_Q` = 4.

So the value of BLOCK_SIZE_Q directly reflects how many queries are grouped into one block that is processed by a single kernel instance.

----------

**Q: Since K is transposed, how can we define the grid over Q? Doesn't transposing affect the grid shape?**

A: Great intuition, but the grid is not tied to how the K matrix is laid out or transposed. Even though K is transposed when computing QK^T, what actually determines the grid is how we split the queries (Q). This is because the goal of the grid is to assign each kernel to compute the output for a subset of the query positions.

The fact that K is transposed just affects how the matmul is performed inside each kernel — not how the kernels are launched. So, we can safely define the grid over Q without worrying about the transposition of K.

----------
**Q: Why is the Y-axis of the grid equal to BATCH_SIZE * NUM_HEADS?**

A: Each attention head is an independent computation, and we typically apply multi-head attention across a batch of sequences. So if you have 4 sequences in a batch and 8 attention heads, you end up with 4 × 8 = 32 completely independent attention calculations. Each of these needs its own Q, K, and V matrices.

Therefore, we launch one kernel per **(head, batch)** pair. That’s why the grid’s Y-dimension is `BATCH_SIZE * NUM_HEADS`. This allows each kernel to process the attention for one head of one sequence in the batch, effectively covering the entire batch in one go.
